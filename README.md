# Giving Garden 🌱

Welcome to Giving Garden!

##
## Description

In this day and age there are multiple organizations requiring donations, support, and needs. However, attempting to identify the specific items each organization needs, where the organizations are based, and information about each organization can be a confusing, strenuous process. Our team decided to help ease this challenge and create a centralized area where NPOs and Donors can meet and interact. We decided to create a website where donors can create a profile, identify numerous Non-Profit Organizations in there area, and localize specific items to donate to those organizations. Similarly, NPOs can create a profile, list the items they need, and spread information about what they stand for. In order to incentivize the donation process, we decided to make the website more engaging with a reward system. As donors complete donations, they get a certain amount of reward points that directly correlate to growing their “giving garden”. The more points a donor gets, the more plants they have in there garden, and the more humanitarian they seem! Overall, our main goal was to create a centralized web page where both NPOs and Donors can collaborate and benefit our world overall. Thus, welcome to Giving Garden!
